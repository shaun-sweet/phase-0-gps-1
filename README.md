# phase-0-gps-1
at this point we have used the following commands:


git clone git@github.com:sweetkeys/phase-0-gps-1.git
cd to get to the proper directory and also move around different directories
ls to make sure i'm in the proper directory and also check the content of the directory i'm in
touch to create a new file
git add . to add the current directory to the git staging
git status to make sure what i added to staging added successfully
git commit -m "message" to commit my files to HEAD and added a message along with it
git push to push the commit to github and allow my GPS partner to also then pull the files to her machine


Also discuss how git tracks changes, different stages, and the process you are going through when you make changes. 
Git first needs to be intialized somehow.  you can do with with git init or in our situation, we used git clone with also does an init to create a repository.  To move the files/directories into git and between different stages you start with using git add in order to add them to the first stage.  The next command you'd use is git commit in order to add your staged changed to the HEAD and the last step I took for this is to push the HEAD to github.com and get it into my respository that I had created.  

After you've made the changes, add, commit, and push your branch to GitHub. Discuss what the commit message should be. What are the best practices?
The commit message should detail everything you have added/changed.  Best practice would be to keep the message looking very similar to how a command would look.  that is short and precise.
