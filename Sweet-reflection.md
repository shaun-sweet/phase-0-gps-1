What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was having difficulty understanding what checkout did or if it was just used for moving between branches.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Checkout!

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I just had the guide but I asked some questions about checkout and how its used in normal workflow.

What still confuses you about git?
fixing merge conflicts, but i feel like I just need some practice on them.  

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was fun!! I look forward to the next one!
